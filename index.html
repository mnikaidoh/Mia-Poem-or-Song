          This song has held a nostalgic quality ever since I first heard it in
          <strong>2010</strong>!

          Come along with me<br>
          And the butterflies and bees<br>
          We can wander through the forest<br>
          And do so as we please<br>
          <br>
          Come along with me<br>
          To a cliff under a tree<br>
          Where we can gaze upon the water<br>
          As an everlasting dream<br>
          <br>
          All of my collections<br>
          I'll share them all with you<br>
          Maybe by next summer<br>
          We won't have changed our tunes<br>
          <br>
          We'll still want to be<br>
          With the butterflies and bees<br>
          Making up new numbers<br>
          And living so merrily<br>
          <br>
          All of my collections<br>
          I'll share them all with you<br>
          I'll be here for you always<br>
          And always be with you<br>
          <br>
          Come along with me<br>
          And the butterflies and bees<br>
          We can wander through the forest<br>
          And do so as we please<br>
          Living so merrily<br>
