    <h1>Island Song</h1>
    <h2><em>Ashley Eriksson</em></h2>
    <p>This song has held a nostalgic quality ever since I first heard it in <strong>2010</strong>!</p>

    <section>
    <p>Come along with me<br>
        And the butterflies and bees<br>
        We can wander through the forest<br>
        And do so as we please<br>
        <br>
        Come along with me<br>
        To a cliff under a tree<br>
        Where we can gaze upon the water<br>
        As an everlasting dream<br>
        <br>
        All of my collections<br>
        I'll share them all with you<br>
        Maybe by next summer<br>
        We won't have changed our tunes<br>
        <br>
        We'll still want to be<br>
        With the butterflies and bees<br>
        Making up new numbers<br>
        And living so merrily<br>
        <br>
        All of my collections<br>
        I'll share them all with you<br>
        I'll be here for you always<br>
        And always be with you<br>
        <br>
        Come along with me<br>
        And the butterflies and bees<br>
        We can wander through the forest<br>
        And do so as we please<br>
        Living so merrily<br>
